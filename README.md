# Simple-Chat-Program-Coded-in-C++(WIP)
This is a basic chat program that requires using two terminals.

The program is invoked as follows:

To invoke the server type ./chat in the first terminal.

If done correctly, the terminal will display an IP and Port # to use. You will need this information for the second terminal.

In the second terminal type ./chat -p (port number) -s (IP number).Where the -p flag indicates the port to connect to and the -s flag indicates the IP address of your friend.

Example: ./chat -p 3790 -s 192.168.47.232

If you want to produce a help message type ./chat -h
